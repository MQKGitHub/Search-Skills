### 🛡️ Search Skills

**Room:** [Search Skills — TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/searchskills)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** May 12, 2025  

### 🎯 Objective
This room focused on developing effective information gathering skills for cybersecurity professionals. The goal was to learn how to evaluate sources, use advanced search techniques, and leverage specialized tools to find technical information efficiently.

---

### 🗝️ Key Concepts  
- **Information Evaluation** — Assessing source credibility by checking author reputation, evidence quality, and corroboration from multiple sources.  
- **Advanced Search Operators** — Using commands like `site:`, `filetype:`, and `-` to refine search engine results.  
- **Shodan** — Search engine for internet-connected devices that reveals servers, IoT devices, and network equipment.  
- **Censys** — Tool for discovering internet assets including hosts, websites, and SSL certificates.  
- **VirusTotal** — Service that scans files/URLs against multiple antivirus engines simultaneously.  
- **CVE Database** — Standardized repository of publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  
- **Manual Pages** — Official documentation for Linux commands accessible via `man` command.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Google/Bing/DuckDuckGo** — Used advanced operators for technical research  
- **Shodan** — Discovered exposed devices and services on the internet  
- **Censys** — Mapped organizational assets and certificate information  
- **VirusTotal** — Analyzed suspicious files for malware detection  
- **Exploit Database** — Researched verified exploit code for vulnerabilities

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Initially struggled with formulating effective search queries  
- Had difficulty assessing source credibility for technical topics  
- Overcame by practicing with real-world scenarios and cross-verifying information  
- Learned to combine multiple search operators for precise results  

---

### 🧠 What I Learned
- The importance of verifying information from multiple authoritative sources  
- How to quickly find technical documentation using `site:` and `filetype:` operators  
- The difference between Shodan (device-focused) and Censys (asset-focused)  
- Why manual pages are essential references for Linux commands  
- How CVEs provide standardized vulnerability identifiers  

---

### 🌐 Real-World Application:
> These search techniques are used daily by security professionals for threat intelligence gathering, vulnerability research, and incident response. Tools like Shodan help identify exposed assets, while CVE databases enable patching prioritization. Advanced search skills are crucial for efficient penetration testing and security audits.

---

### 💭 Reflections:
- Most interesting: Discovering how much device information Shodan reveals  
- Most valuable: Learning to quickly find official documentation  
- Next time: I'd create a cheat sheet of search operators beforehand  
- Key takeaway: "The ability to find accurate information quickly is as important as technical skills in cybersecurity"
